** Setting up ssh
*** yum install openssh-server
*** on source computer:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    ssh-keygen

    cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
#+END_SRC
*** on destination computer:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    cat >> .ssh/authorised_keys
#+END_SRC
    copy the cat at source computer to the file

    C-d to close

*** on source computer:
    emacs .ssh/config

    paste into the file (e.g.):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    Host *
      ForwardX11 yes
      GSSAPIAuthentication=no
      ForwardX11Trusted yes

    Host simonk
      Hostname 172.16.10.122
#+END_SRC

    change ownership:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    chmod -ogrw .ssh/config (remove permission to read and write from Others and Group)
#+END_SRC

*** port forwarding:
    To go immediately to the desired computer (by 1 step rather than ssh on ssh):
    add the following to the config file:

    Host tongariro
    ProxyCommand ssh  dovg nc 172.16.10.122 22 (?)
      

** copying ssh settings from old location to new
*** copy .ssh dir
*** chown -R simon .ssh (change ownership to me)
*** chmod -og-rwx .ssh (remove permission to read write or execute from Others and Group)
